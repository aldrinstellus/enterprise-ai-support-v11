## 🎬 Demo Script

### **Scenario 1: Successful Auto-Unlock** ✅

**Context**: User locked out due to routine failed login attempts (no security threat)

#### Step 1: User Request
**Type**: `I need you to unlock my account`

**Expected AI Response**:
```
Let me check your account status and verify if I can unlock it for you...
```

**Widget Displayed**: **Response Composer** showing:
- ✅ Account successfully unlocked confirmation
- Details:
  - Email: john.doe@company.com
  - Status: ACTIVE (previously locked)
  - Lock Reason: 5 failed login attempts (security protocol)
  - Unlocked By: AI Assistant
- **Key Points**:
  - Account verified and unlocked automatically
  - Lock triggered by routine security measure (5 failed attempts)
  - No security threats detected
  - 2FA recommended for enhanced security
- **Next Steps**:
  - Clear browser cache and cookies
  - Log in using current credentials
  - Set up Two-Factor Authentication
  - Contact support if issues persist

**Stakeholder Talking Points**:
- AI **instantly verified** account status using backend integration
- **Zero human intervention** needed for routine unlocks
- **Security-first**: Only auto-unlocks when no threat flags detected
- **Educational**: Recommends 2FA proactively
- **Time saved**: Resolution in <1 minute vs. 15-30 min with human agent

### **Scenario 2: Security Escalation** 🚨

**Context**: Account locked due to suspicious activity (geographic anomaly, unrecognized device, attack pattern)

#### Step 1: User Request (Same Start)
**Type**: `I need you to unlock my account`

#### Step 2: Trigger Escalation
**Type**: `There's suspicious activity detected`

**Expected AI Response**:
```
I've detected security concerns that require human review. Let me escalate this to our security team right away for your safety.
```

**Widget Displayed**: **Escalation Path** showing 3-stage timeline:

**Stage 1 - AI Account Verification** [✅ COMPLETED]
- Assignee: AI Assistant
- Duration: 1 min
- Notes:
  ```
  Automated security scan completed
  ✓ Account exists and is active
  ✓ User identity verified via support ticket
  ⚠️ Security flags detected requiring human review
  ```

**Stage 2 - Security Flags Detected** [⏳ CURRENT]
- Assignee: Security Automation System
- Status: In Progress
- Critical Findings:
  ```
  🚨 Multiple security concerns identified:

  1. Suspicious Login Location
     • Last successful: San Francisco, CA
     • Failed attempts from: Moscow, Russia (5 attempts)
     • Geographic anomaly: 5,000+ miles

  2. Unrecognized Device
     • Device fingerprint: Unknown
     • Browser: Chrome 118 (Linux)
     • Never seen before on this account

  3. Password Spray Attack Pattern
     • Multiple accounts targeted simultaneously
     • Same IP address attempting various passwords

  ⚠️ AI Decision: Cannot auto-unlock due to security risk
  ✅ Escalating to Security Team for manual review
  ```

**Stage 3 - Security Team Review** [⏱️ PENDING]
- Assignee: Mike Johnson (Security Analyst)
- Expected Response: 30 minutes
- Priority: HIGH - Potential security breach
- Actions:
  ```
  Security analyst will:
  • Verify account owner identity via secondary authentication
  • Review complete login history and patterns
  • Investigate potential account compromise
  • Coordinate with user to secure account
  • Implement additional security measures if needed
  ```

**Recommended Action**:
> Security analyst should contact user via verified phone number to confirm identity before unlocking. Recommend mandatory password reset and 2FA setup after unlock. Monitor account for 48 hours post-unlock.

**Stakeholder Talking Points**:
- AI **intelligently detects** security threats (not just rule-based)
- **Refuses to auto-unlock** when risk is detected (prioritizes security over convenience)
- **Comprehensive escalation** with full context for security team
- **Proactive measures**: Recommends 2FA, password reset, monitoring
- **Clear accountability**: Each stage has assigned owner and SLA
- **Transparency**: User sees the entire escalation process

## 📊 Success Metrics to Highlight

**Before AI (Manual Process)**:
- Average unlock time: 15-30 minutes
- Requires: Support agent availability, manual verification, email/call confirmation
- Volume capacity: Limited by agent bandwidth
- Security review: Often skipped for routine unlocks

**After AI (This Demo)**:
- Routine unlocks: < 1 minute (automated)
- Security escalations: 30 minutes (with full context already gathered)
- Volume capacity: Unlimited (24/7 automation)
- Security review: 100% coverage (AI never skips threat checks)

**Impact**:
- **80%+ of unlocks automated** (based on typical lock reasons)
- **100% security compliance** (every unlock is threat-assessed)
- **Customer satisfaction**: Instant resolution vs. waiting for agent
- **Agent productivity**: Focus on complex security cases, not routine unlocks

## 💬 Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: What if the AI makes a mistake and unlocks a compromised account?**
A: The AI only auto-unlocks when **zero security flags** are detected. Any anomaly (geographic, device, pattern) triggers human review. This makes it safer than manual process (where agents might overlook flags).

**Q: Can a hacker bypass this by just asking the AI?**
A: No. The AI verifies account ownership through the support ticket system (authenticated session). Additionally, the `verify_account_status` API requires backend authentication. A hacker can't just chat their way into an unlock.

**Q: How does this scale to thousands of unlock requests?**
A: The AI handles unlimited concurrent requests. Backend APIs are horizontally scalable. The 20% that require human review go into a prioritized queue (security team workflow).

**Q: What about compliance (SOC 2, GDPR, etc.)?**
A: All unlock actions are logged with full audit trail (who, when, why, IP address). Security escalations create permanent Jira records. Actually improves compliance vs. manual process (where documentation is inconsistent).

**Q: Can we customize the security rules?**
A: Yes. The security flags are configurable (e.g., define "suspicious" geographic distance, add/remove attack patterns). The AI adapts to your specific security policies.
